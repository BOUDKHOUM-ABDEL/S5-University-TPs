# 🏛️ Semester 5 Traveaux Pratiques (TPs)

This repository contains all the practical assignments, projects, and lab work (Traveaux Pratiques - TPs) completed during my **University Semester 5**.

The main focus areas for these TPs are **Python Programming**, **Java Development**, and **Machine Learning** fundamentals.

## 🎯 Technologies and Core Concepts

| Technology | Core Concepts Covered |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Python** | Data Structures, Algorithms, File Handling, Web Scraping (if applicable). |
| **Java** | Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), GUI Development (Swing/JavaFX), Exception Handling. |
| **Machine Learning (ML)** | Supervised/Unsupervised Learning, Linear Regression, Classification (e.g., K-Nearest Neighbors), Data Preprocessing, Libraries (Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn). |

## 📂 Project Structure and Content

The TPs are organized into directories based on the technology or specific course.

### 🐍 Python TPs

* **[`/Python-TPs/TP1-Data-Analysis`](#)**: Focus on using Pandas for data manipulation and visualization.
* **[`/Python-TPs/TP2-Algorithms`](#)**: Implementation of various sorting or searching algorithms.
* **[`/Python-TPs/TP3-Networking-App`](#)**: (Example: A simple client-server application).

### ☕ Java TPs

* **[`/Java-TPs/TP1-OOP-Concepts`](#)**: Classes, inheritance, polymorphism examples.
* **[`/Java-TPs/TP2-GUI-Application`](#)**: A small desktop application built with Swing or JavaFX.
* **[`/Java-TPs/TP3-Database-Connectivity`](#)**: Connecting a Java application to a database (e.g., JDBC).

### 🤖 Machine Learning TPs

* **[`/ML-TPs/TP1-Linear-Regression`](#)**: Implementing and evaluating a simple linear model.
* **[`/ML-TPs/TP2-Classification-Model`](#)**: Using a dataset for a classification task (e.g., using scikit-learn).
* **[`/ML-TPs/TP3-Data-Preprocessing`](#)**: Scripts for cleaning, scaling, and preparing data.
